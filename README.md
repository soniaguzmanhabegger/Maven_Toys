### 🚀 Background
This report is based on fictional data generated in ChatGPT. The command was to generate 7 months data of sales and menu items for 3 restaurants in France. Since I want to analyze sales performance by time of day and day of the week, transaction dates were prompted as well.

The idea was to create an infographic to convey insights directly into the report, in structured sections, and with customer user experience in sight.
